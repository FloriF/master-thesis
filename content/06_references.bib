  abstract   = {Background: The ‘doorway effect’, or ‘location updating effect’, claims that we tend to forget items of recent signifi-
cance immediately after crossing a boundary. Previous research suggests that such a forgetting effect occurs both at
physical boundaries (e.g., moving from one room to another via a door) and metaphysical boundaries (e.g., imagining
traversing a doorway, or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer). Here, we aimed to
conceptually replicate this effect using virtual and physical environments.
Methods: Across four experiments, we measured participants’ hit and false alarm rates to memory probes for items
recently encountered either in the same or previous room. Experiments 1 and 2 used highly immersive virtual reality
without and with working memory load (Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). Experiment 3 used passive video watch-
ing and Experiment 4 used active real-life movement. Data analysis was conducted using frequentist as well as Bayes-
ian inference statistics.
Results: Across this series of experiments, we observed no significant effect of doorways on forgetting. In Experi-
ment 2, however, signal detection was impaired when participants responded to probes after moving through door-
ways, such that false alarm rates were increased for mismatched recognition probes. Thus, under working memory
load, memory was more susceptible to interference after moving through doorways.
Conclusions: This study presents evidence that is inconsistent with the location updating effect as it has previously
been reported. Our findings call into question the generalisability and robustness of this effect to slight paradigm
alterations and, indeed, what factors contributed to the effect observed in previous studies.},

to selectively retrieve and re-experience more discrete episodes from our past, raising the
possibility that some elements become tightly related to each other in memory, while others do
not. The current series of experiments was designed to ask how shifts in context during an
experience influence how we remember the past. Specifically, we asked how context shifts
influence our ability to remember the relative order of past events, a hallmark of episodic memory.
We found that memory for the order of events was enhanced within, as compared to across,
context shifts, or ‘boundaries’ (Experiment 1). Next, we showed that this relative enhancement in
order memory was eliminated when across-item associative processing was disrupted (Experiment
2), suggesting that context shifts have a selective effect on sequential binding. Finally, we provide
evidence that the act of making order memory judgments involves the reactivation of
representations that intervened, or bridged, the tested items (Experiment 3). Together, these data
suggest that boundaries may serve to parse continuous experience into sequences of contextually
related events and that this organization facilitates remembering the temporal order of events that
share the same context.},

sequence of this segmentation is that when people transport objects from one location to another,
memory is worse than if people move across a large location. In two experiments participants navigated
through a virtual environment, and recognition memory was tested in either the presence or the absence
of a location shift for objects that were recently interacted with (i.e., just picked up or set down). Of
particular concern here is whether this location updating effect is due to (a) differences in retention
intervals as a result of the navigation process, (b) a temporary disruption in cognitive processing that
may occur as a result of the updating processes, or (c) a need to manage multiple event models, as
has been suggested in prior research. Experiment 1 explored whether retention interval is driving
this effect by recording travel times from the acquisition of an object and the probe time. The results
revealed that travel times were similar, thereby rejecting a retention interval explanation. Experiment
2 explored whether a temporary disruption in processing is producing the effect by introducing a 3-
second delay prior to the presentation of a memory probe. The pattern of results was not affected by
adding a delay, thereby rejecting a temporary disruption account. These results are interpreted in the
context of the event horizon model, which suggests that when there are multiple event models that
contain common elements there is interference at retrieval, which compromises performance.},

represents how intense is the sensation of actually being there, inside the virtual environment (VE), forgetting how
technology mediates the experience. Our paper explores how locomotion influences presence, studying two different ways
of artificial movement along the VE: walking-in-place (through head bobbing detection) and indirect walking (through
touchpad). To evaluate that influence, a narrative-neutral maze was created, from where 41 participants (N=41) had to
escape. Measuring presence is a controversial topic since there is not a single, objective measure but a wide range of
metrics depending on the different theoretical basis. For this reason, we have used for the first time, representative metrics
from all three traditional dimensions of presence: subjective presence (SP) (self-reported through questionnaires),
behavioral presence (BP) (obtained from unconscious reactions while inside the VE), and physiological presence (PP)
[usually measured using heart rate or electrodermal activity (EDA)]. SP was measured with the ITC-SOPI questionnaire, BP
by collecting the participants’ reactions, and PP by using a bracelet that registered EDA. The results show two main findings:
(i) There is no correlation between the different presence metrics. This opens the door to a simpler way of measuring
presence in an objective, reliable way. (ii) There is no significant difference between the two locomotion techniques for any
of the three metrics, which shows that the authenticity of VR does not rely on how you move within the VE.},

walking through a doorway. (This impairment may be adaptive, as when one “flushes” a cache in a computer program when
completing a function.) But when exactly does this impairment occur? Existing work has not asked this question: based on a
reasonable assumption that forgetting occurs when we cross event boundaries, memory has only been tested after this point.
Here we demonstrate that even visual cues to an impending event boundary (that one has not yet crossed) suffice to trigger
forgetting. Subjects viewed an immersive animation that simulated walking through a room. Before their walk, they saw a list
of pseudo-words, and immediately after their walk, their recognition memory was tested. During their walk, some subjects
passed through a doorway, while others did not (equating time and distance traveled). Memory was impaired (relative to the
“no doorway” condition) not only when they passed through the doorway, but also when they were tested just before they
would have crossed the doorway. Additional controls confirmed that this was due to the anticipation of event boundaries
(rather than differential surprise or visual complexity). Visual processing may proactively “flush” memory to some degree
in preparation for future events.},

technology that allows us to alter and create designed environments with great freedom over the visual, audio, and narrative
elements. This freedom would benefit from further guidelines that detail approaches and implementations to best achieve desired
information delivery goals. In this paper we present findings of a study that applies location-based memory strategies to VR
environments, with the aim to aid word list recall without the subjects being required to apply any memory strategy themselves.
Our findings suggest that VR may interfere with the incidental processing of multiple rooms and potential aid to recall as
demonstrated in real world studies},

memory for individual episodes relies on the ability to use shifts in spatiotem-

of experiences in spatial and episodic domains may therefore share neural
underpinnings, manifesting in similar behavioral phenomena and cognitive
biases. Here, we review evidence for such shared mechanisms, focusing on
the key role of boundaries in spatial and episodic memory. We propose that a
fundamental [259_TD$DIF]event boundary detection mechanism enables navigation in both
the spatial and episodic domains, and serves to form cohesive representations
that can be used to predict and guide future behavior.},

  title      = {An exploration of the effect of multi-sensoriy experience on the doorway phenomenon},
  year       = {2020},
  abstract   = {Doorways are a necessity to interior environments but are often placed with intention toward maximizing spatial capacity as opposed to creating a spatial experience. Previous studies have shown that memory for information introduced to a person is harder to remember after traversing a doorway than it is without a doorway present (Pettijohn and Radvansky, 2010, 2016; Radvansky et al., 2011, 2015; Radvansky and Copeland, 2006). However, in a designed space, there are many additional sensory factors present when changing rooms and their impact has not yet been explored. The goals of the research were (1) to identify how sensory input might affect the doorway phenomenon through a literature review and (2) to investigate the effects of visual depth on the doorway phenomenon using a Virtual Reality construct created with a program used specifically in design fields. The literary analysis indicates that sensory perception, emotion, and ability have been shown to work interchangeably in their effect on human experience, including memory (Augustin, 2009; Curiel and Radvansky, 1998; Herz, 1998, 2004; Herz and Schooler, 2002; Mackworth, 1965; Proffitt, 2006a, 2006b; Tyng et al., 2017; Witt and Proffitt, 2008) and may be integral in the influence of the doorway phenomenon on memory recall ability. The VR trials were unable to determine that visual depth has a significant impact on memory regarding the doorway phenomenon. This research is an initial step toward enabling interior designers to make the best- informed decisions about how doorways can be used as a tool to manipulate a user’s experience of a designed space.},

The subjects' task was to detect the movement of one of several objects across the surface of a tabletop after a retention interval during which time all objects were occluded from view. Previous experiments have contrasted performance in this task after rotations of observers' observation point with rotations of just the objects themselves. They found that subjects who walk or move to new observation points perform better than those whose observation point remains constant. This superior performance by mobile observers has been attributed to the influence of non-visual information derived from the proprioceptive or vestibular systems. Our experimental results show that purely visual information derived from simulated movement can also improve subjects' performance, although the performance differences manifested themselves primarily in improved response times rather than accuracy of the responses themselves.},

  abstract  = {This study explores location-based prospective memory. People often have to remember to do things when in a 
particular location, such as buying tissues the next time they are in the supermarket. For event cognition theory, 
location is important for structuring events. However, because event cognition has not been used to examine 
prospective memory, the question remains of how multiple events will influence prospective memory performance. 
In our experiments, people delivered messages from store to store in a virtual shopping mall as an ongoing task. The 
prospective tasks were to do certain activities in certain stores. For Experiment 1, each trial involved one prospective 
memory task to be done in a single location at one of three delays. The virtual environment and location cues were 
effective for prospective memory, and performance was unaffected by delay. For Experiment 2, each trial involved 
two prospective memory tasks, given in either one or two instruction locations, and to be done in either one or 
two store locations. There was improved performance when people received instructions from two locations and 
did both tasks in one location relative to other combinations. This demonstrates that location-based event structure 
influences how well people perform on prospective memory tasks.},

Subjects exhibited a behavioral transition, from frontal walking to body rotation,
while walking from broad to narrow apertures. Here, we tested the same basic
protocol, using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). Overall, results show the same
basic behavior (shoulder rotation through a narrow door). However, optimal
adaptive behavior (avoiding collision with the door’s borders) required both the
presence of a dynamic representation of the subject’s body (in the visual display)
and of a vibrotactile feedback, signaling approach of the subject’s shoulder
towards the doorpost.},

This paper investigates the effects of visual realism on object location memory in virtual reality, taking account of individual differences, gaze, and locomotion. Participants freely explored two environments which varied in visual realism, and then recalled the locations of objects by returning the misplaced objects back to original locations. Overall, we did not find a significant relationship between visual realism and object location memory. We found, however, that individual differences such as spatial ability and gender accounted for more variance than visual realism. Gaze and locomotion analysis suggest that participants exhibited longer gaze duration and more clustered movement patterns in the low realism condition. Preliminary inspection further found that locomotion hotspots coincided with objects that showed a significant gaze time difference between high and low visual realism levels. These results suggest that high visual realism still provides positive spatial learning affordances but the effects are more intricate.},

Little research, however, has focused on their impact on learning. These techniques generally transfer control from the user to the system, making the user more passive and reducing kinesthetic feedback. In this paper, we present an experiment that evaluates the impact of projection-based guidance techniques on spatial memorization. We investigate the roles of user (handheld) vs. system control (robotic arm) guidance and of kinesthetic feedback on memorization. Results show (1) higher recall rates with system-controlled guidance, (2) no significant influence of kinesthetic feedback on recall under system control, and (3) the visibility and noticeability of objects impact memorization.},

Psychology research informs us that humans access memories through cues, or "memory hooks," acquired at the time we learn the information. In this paper, we show that kinesthetic cues, or the awareness of parts of our body's position with respect to itself or to the environment, are useful for recalling the positions of objects in space. We report a user study demonstrating a 19% increase in spatial memory for information controlled with a touchscreen, which provides direct kinesthetic cues, as compared to a standard mouse interface. We also report results indicating that females may benefit more than males from using the touchscreen device.},

  abstract  = {Spatial navigation is a core cognitive ability in humans and animals. Neuroimaging studies have
identified two functionally-defined brain regions that activate during navigational tasks and also
during passive viewing of navigationally-relevant stimuli such as environmental scenes: the
parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the retrosplenial complex (RSC). Recent findings indicate
that the PPA and RSC play distinct and complementary roles in spatial navigation, with the PPA
more concerned with representation of the local visual scene and RSC more concerned with
situating the scene within the broader spatial environment. These findings are a first step towards
understanding the separate components of the cortical network that mediates spatial navigation in
humans.},
