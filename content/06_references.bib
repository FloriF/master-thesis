@Article{McFadyen_2021,
  abstract   = {Background: The ‘doorway effect’, or ‘location updating effect’, claims that we tend to forget items of recent signifi-
cance immediately after crossing a boundary. Previous research suggests that such a forgetting effect occurs both at
physical boundaries (e.g., moving from one room to another via a door) and metaphysical boundaries (e.g., imagining
traversing a doorway, or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer). Here, we aimed to
conceptually replicate this effect using virtual and physical environments.
Methods: Across four experiments, we measured participants’ hit and false alarm rates to memory probes for items
recently encountered either in the same or previous room. Experiments 1 and 2 used highly immersive virtual reality
without and with working memory load (Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). Experiment 3 used passive video watch-
ing and Experiment 4 used active real-life movement. Data analysis was conducted using frequentist as well as Bayes-
ian inference statistics.
Results: Across this series of experiments, we observed no significant effect of doorways on forgetting. In Experi-
ment 2, however, signal detection was impaired when participants responded to probes after moving through door-
ways, such that false alarm rates were increased for mismatched recognition probes. Thus, under working memory
load, memory was more susceptible to interference after moving through doorways.
Conclusions: This study presents evidence that is inconsistent with the location updating effect as it has previously
been reported. Our findings call into question the generalisability and robustness of this effect to slight paradigm
alterations and, indeed, what factors contributed to the effect observed in previous studies.},

  abstract  = {Previous work has shown a decline in memory for objects carried through a doorway
versus across a room. The aim of the current study is to extend this work to
understand how variations in perceptual experience during these event shifts influence
this finding. First a change in procedure to reduce memory load to a single item was
assessed. Next we explored whether performance is influenced by spatial distance
versus spatial categories, the ability to perceptually preview the next location, and
changes in the colour and texture of the walls. The location updating effect was
consistently observed for all manipulations, suggesting that such event transformations
have a robust influence on human memory. This suggests that event cognition is
driven more by the use of perceptual information to infer or impose a categorical shift
from one event to another rather than by the nature of perceptual information
available at the time},

  abstract  = {Previous research has reported that walking through a doorway to a new location makes
memory for objects and events experienced in the previous location less accurate. This
effect, termed the location updating effect, has been used to suggest that location changes
are used to mark boundaries between events in memory: memories for objects
encountered within the current event are more available than those from beyond an
event boundary. Within a computer-generated memory task, participants navigated
through virtual rooms, walking through doorways, and interacting with objects. The
accuracy and their subjective experience of their memory for the objects (remember/
know and confidence) were assessed. The findings showed that shifts in location
decreased accurate responses associated with the subjective experience of remembering
but not those associated with the experience of knowing, even when considering only the
most confident responses in each condition. These findings demonstrate that a shift in
location selectively impacts recollection and so contributes to our understanding of
boundaries in event memory},

  abstract  = {Episodic memory allows us to re-experience the past by recovering the sequences of events that
characterize those prior experiences. Interestingly, although experience is continuous, we are able
to selectively retrieve and re-experience more discrete episodes from our past, raising the
possibility that some elements become tightly related to each other in memory, while others do
not. The current series of experiments was designed to ask how shifts in context during an
experience influence how we remember the past. Specifically, we asked how context shifts
influence our ability to remember the relative order of past events, a hallmark of episodic memory.
We found that memory for the order of events was enhanced within, as compared to across,
context shifts, or ‘boundaries’ (Experiment 1). Next, we showed that this relative enhancement in
order memory was eliminated when across-item associative processing was disrupted (Experiment
2), suggesting that context shifts have a selective effect on sequential binding. Finally, we provide
evidence that the act of making order memory judgments involves the reactivation of
representations that intervened, or bridged, the tested items (Experiment 3). Together, these data
suggest that boundaries may serve to parse continuous experience into sequences of contextually
related events and that this organization facilitates remembering the temporal order of events that
share the same context.},

  abstract  = {According to event cognition theory, people segment experience into separate event models. One con-
sequence of this segmentation is that when people transport objects from one location to another,
memory is worse than if people move across a large location. In two experiments participants navigated
through a virtual environment, and recognition memory was tested in either the presence or the absence
of a location shift for objects that were recently interacted with (i.e., just picked up or set down). Of
particular concern here is whether this location updating effect is due to (a) differences in retention
intervals as a result of the navigation process, (b) a temporary disruption in cognitive processing that
may occur as a result of the updating processes, or (c) a need to manage multiple event models, as
has been suggested in prior research. Experiment 1 explored whether retention interval is driving
this effect by recording travel times from the acquisition of an object and the probe time. The results
revealed that travel times were similar, thereby rejecting a retention interval explanation. Experiment
2 explored whether a temporary disruption in processing is producing the effect by introducing a 3-
second delay prior to the presentation of a memory probe. The pattern of results was not affected by
adding a delay, thereby rejecting a temporary disruption account. These results are interpreted in the
context of the event horizon model, which suggests that when there are multiple event models that
contain common elements there is interference at retrieval, which compromises performance.},

of artificial movement along the VE: walking-in-place (through head bobbing detection) and indirect walking (through
touchpad). To evaluate that influence, a narrative-neutral maze was created, from where 41 participants (N=41) had to
escape. Measuring presence is a controversial topic since there is not a single, objective measure but a wide range of
metrics depending on the different theoretical basis. For this reason, we have used for the first time, representative metrics
from all three traditional dimensions of presence: subjective presence (SP) (self-reported through questionnaires),
behavioral presence (BP) (obtained from unconscious reactions while inside the VE), and physiological presence (PP)
[usually measured using heart rate or electrodermal activity (EDA)]. SP was measured with the ITC-SOPI questionnaire, BP
by collecting the participants’ reactions, and PP by using a bracelet that registered EDA. The results show two main findings:
(i) There is no correlation between the different presence metrics. This opens the door to a simpler way of measuring
presence in an objective, reliable way. (ii) There is no significant difference between the two locomotion techniques for any
of the three metrics, which shows that the authenticity of VR does not rely on how you move within the VE.},

@Article{Wang_2023,
  abstract   = {Visual input arrives in a continuous stream, but we often experience the world as a sequence of discrete events — and
the boundaries between events have important consequences for our mental lives. Perhaps the best example of this is that
memory not only declines as a function of elapsed time, but is also impaired when crossing an event boundary — as when
walking through a doorway. (This impairment may be adaptive, as when one “flushes” a cache in a computer program when
completing a function.) But when exactly does this impairment occur? Existing work has not asked this question: based on a
reasonable assumption that forgetting occurs when we cross event boundaries, memory has only been tested after this point.
Here we demonstrate that even visual cues to an impending event boundary (that one has not yet crossed) suffice to trigger
forgetting. Subjects viewed an immersive animation that simulated walking through a room. Before their walk, they saw a list
of pseudo-words, and immediately after their walk, their recognition memory was tested. During their walk, some subjects
passed through a doorway, while others did not (equating time and distance traveled). Memory was impaired (relative to the
“no doorway” condition) not only when they passed through the doorway, but also when they were tested just before they
would have crossed the doorway. Additional controls confirmed that this was due to the anticipation of event boundaries
(rather than differential surprise or visual complexity). Visual processing may proactively “flush” memory to some degree
in preparation for future events.},

@Article{Brunec_2018,
  abstract  = {Efficient navigation from one place to another is facilitated by the ability to use
spatial boundaries to segment routes into their component parts. Similarly,
memory for individual episodes relies on the ability to use shifts in spatiotem-
poral contexts to segment the ongoing stream of experience. The segmentation
of experiences in spatial and episodic domains may therefore share neural
underpinnings, manifesting in similar behavioral phenomena and cognitive
biases. Here, we review evidence for such shared mechanisms, focusing on
the key role of boundaries in spatial and episodic memory. We propose that a
fundamental [259_TD$DIF]event boundary detection mechanism enables navigation in both
the spatial and episodic domains, and serves to form cohesive representations
that can be used to predict and guide future behavior.},
