  abstract   = {Background: The ‘doorway effect’, or ‘location updating effect’, claims that we tend to forget items of recent signifi-
cance immediately after crossing a boundary. Previous research suggests that such a forgetting effect occurs both at
physical boundaries (e.g., moving from one room to another via a door) and metaphysical boundaries (e.g., imagining
traversing a doorway, or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer). Here, we aimed to
conceptually replicate this effect using virtual and physical environments.
Methods: Across four experiments, we measured participants’ hit and false alarm rates to memory probes for items
recently encountered either in the same or previous room. Experiments 1 and 2 used highly immersive virtual reality
without and with working memory load (Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). Experiment 3 used passive video watch-
ing and Experiment 4 used active real-life movement. Data analysis was conducted using frequentist as well as Bayes-
ian inference statistics.
Results: Across this series of experiments, we observed no significant effect of doorways on forgetting. In Experi-
ment 2, however, signal detection was impaired when participants responded to probes after moving through door-
ways, such that false alarm rates were increased for mismatched recognition probes. Thus, under working memory
load, memory was more susceptible to interference after moving through doorways.
Conclusions: This study presents evidence that is inconsistent with the location updating effect as it has previously
been reported. Our findings call into question the generalisability and robustness of this effect to slight paradigm
alterations and, indeed, what factors contributed to the effect observed in previous studies.},

changes in the colour and texture of the walls. The location updating effect was
consistently observed for all manipulations, suggesting that such event transformations
have a robust influence on human memory. This suggests that event cognition is
driven more by the use of perceptual information to infer or impose a categorical shift
from one event to another rather than by the nature of perceptual information
available at the time},

decreased accurate responses associated with the subjective experience of remembering

to selectively retrieve and re-experience more discrete episodes from our past, raising the
possibility that some elements become tightly related to each other in memory, while others do
not. The current series of experiments was designed to ask how shifts in context during an
experience influence how we remember the past. Specifically, we asked how context shifts
influence our ability to remember the relative order of past events, a hallmark of episodic memory.
We found that memory for the order of events was enhanced within, as compared to across,
context shifts, or ‘boundaries’ (Experiment 1). Next, we showed that this relative enhancement in
order memory was eliminated when across-item associative processing was disrupted (Experiment
2), suggesting that context shifts have a selective effect on sequential binding. Finally, we provide
evidence that the act of making order memory judgments involves the reactivation of
representations that intervened, or bridged, the tested items (Experiment 3). Together, these data
suggest that boundaries may serve to parse continuous experience into sequences of contextually
related events and that this organization facilitates remembering the temporal order of events that
share the same context.},

sequence of this segmentation is that when people transport objects from one location to another,
memory is worse than if people move across a large location. In two experiments participants navigated
through a virtual environment, and recognition memory was tested in either the presence or the absence
of a location shift for objects that were recently interacted with (i.e., just picked up or set down). Of
particular concern here is whether this location updating effect is due to (a) differences in retention
intervals as a result of the navigation process, (b) a temporary disruption in cognitive processing that
may occur as a result of the updating processes, or (c) a need to manage multiple event models, as
has been suggested in prior research. Experiment 1 explored whether retention interval is driving
this effect by recording travel times from the acquisition of an object and the probe time. The results
revealed that travel times were similar, thereby rejecting a retention interval explanation. Experiment
2 explored whether a temporary disruption in processing is producing the effect by introducing a 3-
second delay prior to the presentation of a memory probe. The pattern of results was not affected by
adding a delay, thereby rejecting a temporary disruption account. These results are interpreted in the
context of the event horizon model, which suggests that when there are multiple event models that
contain common elements there is interference at retrieval, which compromises performance.},

metrics depending on the different theoretical basis. For this reason, we have used for the first time, representative metrics
from all three traditional dimensions of presence: subjective presence (SP) (self-reported through questionnaires),
behavioral presence (BP) (obtained from unconscious reactions while inside the VE), and physiological presence (PP)
[usually measured using heart rate or electrodermal activity (EDA)]. SP was measured with the ITC-SOPI questionnaire, BP
by collecting the participants’ reactions, and PP by using a bracelet that registered EDA. The results show two main findings:
(i) There is no correlation between the different presence metrics. This opens the door to a simpler way of measuring
presence in an objective, reliable way. (ii) There is no significant difference between the two locomotion techniques for any
of the three metrics, which shows that the authenticity of VR does not rely on how you move within the VE.},

  abstract   = {Visual input arrives in a continuous stream, but we often experience the world as a sequence of discrete events — and
the boundaries between events have important consequences for our mental lives. Perhaps the best example of this is that
memory not only declines as a function of elapsed time, but is also impaired when crossing an event boundary — as when
walking through a doorway. (This impairment may be adaptive, as when one “flushes” a cache in a computer program when
completing a function.) But when exactly does this impairment occur? Existing work has not asked this question: based on a
reasonable assumption that forgetting occurs when we cross event boundaries, memory has only been tested after this point.
Here we demonstrate that even visual cues to an impending event boundary (that one has not yet crossed) suffice to trigger
forgetting. Subjects viewed an immersive animation that simulated walking through a room. Before their walk, they saw a list
of pseudo-words, and immediately after their walk, their recognition memory was tested. During their walk, some subjects
passed through a doorway, while others did not (equating time and distance traveled). Memory was impaired (relative to the
“no doorway” condition) not only when they passed through the doorway, but also when they were tested just before they
would have crossed the doorway. Additional controls confirmed that this was due to the anticipation of event boundaries
(rather than differential surprise or visual complexity). Visual processing may proactively “flush” memory to some degree
in preparation for future events.},

information delivery goals. In this paper we present findings of a study that applies location-based memory strategies to VR
environments, with the aim to aid word list recall without the subjects being required to apply any memory strategy themselves.
Our findings suggest that VR may interfere with the incidental processing of multiple rooms and potential aid to recall as
demonstrated in real world studies},

memory for individual episodes relies on the ability to use shifts in spatiotem-

of experiences in spatial and episodic domains may therefore share neural
underpinnings, manifesting in similar behavioral phenomena and cognitive
biases. Here, we review evidence for such shared mechanisms, focusing on
the key role of boundaries in spatial and episodic memory. We propose that a
fundamental [259_TD$DIF]event boundary detection mechanism enables navigation in both
the spatial and episodic domains, and serves to form cohesive representations
that can be used to predict and guide future behavior.},

  title      = {An exploration of the effect of multi-sensoriy experience on the doorway phenomenon},
  year       = {2020},
  abstract   = {Doorways are a necessity to interior environments but are often placed with intention toward maximizing spatial capacity as opposed to creating a spatial experience. Previous studies have shown that memory for information introduced to a person is harder to remember after traversing a doorway than it is without a doorway present (Pettijohn & Radvansky, 2010, 2016; Radvansky et al., 2011, 2015; Radvansky & Copeland, 2006). However, in a designed space, there are many additional sensory factors present when changing rooms and their impact has not yet been explored. The goals of the research were (1) to identify how sensory input might affect the doorway phenomenon through a literature review and (2) to investigate the effects of visual depth on the doorway phenomenon using a Virtual Reality construct created with a program used specifically in design fields. The literary analysis indicates that sensory perception, emotion, and ability have been shown to work interchangeably in their effect on human experience, including memory (Augustin, 2009; Curiel & Radvansky, 1998; Herz, 1998, 2004; Herz & Schooler, 2002; Mackworth, 1965; Proffitt, 2006a, 2006b; Tyng et al., 2017; Witt & Proffitt, 2008) and may be integral in the influence of the doorway phenomenon on memory recall ability. The VR trials were unable to determine that visual depth has a significant impact on memory regarding the doorway phenomenon. This research is an initial step toward enabling interior designers to make the best- informed decisions about how doorways can be used as a tool to manipulate a user’s experience of a designed space.},

The subjects' task was to detect the movement of one of several objects across the surface of a tabletop after a retention interval during which time all objects were occluded from view. Previous experiments have contrasted performance in this task after rotations of observers' observation point with rotations of just the objects themselves. They found that subjects who walk or move to new observation points perform better than those whose observation point remains constant. This superior performance by mobile observers has been attributed to the influence of non-visual information derived from the proprioceptive or vestibular systems. Our experimental results show that purely visual information derived from simulated movement can also improve subjects' performance, although the performance differences manifested themselves primarily in improved response times rather than accuracy of the responses themselves.},
